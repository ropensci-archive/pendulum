Time classes for R, w/ time mocking capability via [timefuzz][]

**Why?** - Some programming languages support [monkey patching][monkey]. However, R does not officially allow this (there's a way to do it, but it's a hack). Therefore, the only way that I can think of to "mock time" is to use a different set of time classes/objects. That is, we can't just mock time using `Sys.Date()` directly as there's no way to monkey patch the code behind that function.  Some may say it's good that R doesn't officially support monkey patching; there's definitely upsides; but a downside is that mocking things like time becomes difficult.

- `clock()` is designed for setting a specific time
- `now()` is designed for getting the current time AND is mockable
- `sys_time()` and `sys_date()` are drop in replacements for `Sys.time()` and `Sys.Date()` AND are mockable
